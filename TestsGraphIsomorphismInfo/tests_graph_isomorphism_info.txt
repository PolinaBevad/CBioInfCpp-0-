Graph isomorphism tests results (A and B are isomorphic): Function "SubGraphsInscribed"

Results (number of vertices - number of edges : duration)
250-3500 : 40 sec         examples of input graphs: A is in inA-250-3500.txt, B is in inB-250-3500.txt
250-350  <1 sec           examples of input graphs: A is in inA-250-350.txt, B is in inB-250-350.txt
2500-3500 7 min           examples of input graphs: A is in inA-2500-3500.txt, B is in inB-2500-3500.txt
1250-1350 1 min 15 sec    examples of input graphs: A is in inA-1250-1350.txt, B is in inB-1250-1350.txt
Graphs in the input files are set as list of their edges (directed, unweighted)
