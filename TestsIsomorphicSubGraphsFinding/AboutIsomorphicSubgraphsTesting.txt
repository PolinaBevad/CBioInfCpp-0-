B_inA_Directed_¹1.txt and B_inA_UnDirected_¹1 contains results how the function SubGraphsInscribed finds in the graph A some subgraphs that are isomorphic to graph B.

First in these files graphs A and B are given (edge list format).

Below one may find how many subgraphs in the A were found: i.e. 36 items for the case we consider A and B as directed and 216 items for the case we consider them as undirected.

Bolow these subgraphs are given. Every of them is marked with "G1: " as header - don't pay attention for that.
